                        As a team of about 20 members, we added features and functionalities
                        to this existing banking application. We added functionalities that allow users to help budget their money and invest in crypto/stocks.
                        The project is written in C# for the backend web api and the front end uses Angular. The original application allows users to login
                        or register if they do not have an account. It then lets the access their checking and savings accounts. Track their flow of money
                        to/from the accounts and to transfer funds between the accounts. They also have a profile page with some other ther information needed
                        for the account. Below I go into more details about these features the team I was part of added to this app.

                           This is a list of technologies used in our app. The main ones inclue ASP.NET Identity for Authentication, Microsoft Azure
                           for our SQL DB + Web API, and Angular for the front end using Node JS and Bootstrap. The Back end also had unit testing with MOQ and
                           the front end used Jasmine and Karma for testing.

                            The login uses the username/email of the user to log them into the system. We used ASP.NET Core Identity to accomplish this.
                            That way the data is encrypted through Identity and we are able to have a token for the session. As part of our project, we
                            added Two Factor Authentication to the app. Since it is a banking app, adding more security is crucial in order to prevent
                            break-ins. You get an email after clicking login which prompts you to click a link to verify the two-factor. Once done, you can
                            access the pages in our app.

                            The app allows users to invest in stocks and crypto. The stocks uses the Yahoo Finance data for stock prices and displays

                            buy/sell more than you can based on your funds/owned shares. Most of this info goes the same for crypto, but instead of using
                            Yahoo Finance data, the data is grabbed from Coin Gecko.

                            and allocate it to spend: 50% on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% into savings. The app will take away from
                            users wants if their needs category is larger than 50%. It also takes a few other things into consideration
                            when calculating. Finally, This information is shows and explained to the user at each step to give them
                            a detailed explaination. They also recieve a graph for a visual representation.
